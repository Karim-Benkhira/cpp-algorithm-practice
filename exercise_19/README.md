# CircleAreaInscribedInSquare Program

This C++ program takes user input for the side length of a square, calculates the area of the circle inscribed in the square, and then prints the result to the console.

## Description

The program consists of three functions:
- `ReadSquareSide`: Takes no parameters and returns the side length of the square entered by the user.
- `CircleAreaInscribedInSquare`: Takes a float parameter `A` (side length of the square) and returns the area of the circle inscribed in the square.
- `PrintResult`: Takes a float parameter `Area` and prints the area of the circle to the console.

The `main` function calls these functions to read the side length of the square, calculate the area of the inscribed circle, and then print the result.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Compile the program using your preferred C++ compiler.
4. Run the executable.

## Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

float ReadSquareSide()
{
  float A;
  cout << "Please Enter Square Side : " << endl;
  cin >> A;
  return A;
}

float CircleAreaInscribedInSquare(float A)
{
  const float Pi = 3.141592653589793238;
  float Area = (Pi * pow(A, 2)) / 4;
  return Area;
}

void PrintResult(float Area)
{
  cout << "Circle Area is : " << Area << endl;
}

int main()
{
  PrintResult(CircleAreaInscribedInSquare(ReadSquareSide()));
  return 0;
}
