# CircleArea Program

This C++ program takes user input for the radius of a circle, calculates its area, and then prints the result to the console.

## Description

The program consists of three functions:
- `ReadRadious`: Takes no parameters and returns the radius of the circle entered by the user.
- `CircleArea`: Takes a float parameter `R` (radius) and returns the area of the circle.
- `PrintResult`: Takes a float parameter `Area` and prints the area of the circle to the console.

The `main` function calls these functions to read the radius of the circle, calculate its area, and then print the result.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Compile the program using your preferred C++ compiler.
4. Run the executable.

## Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

float ReadRadious()
{
  float R;
  cout << "Please Enter Radius R : " << endl;
  cin >> R;
  return R;
}

float CircleArea(float R)
{
  const float Pi = 3.141592653589793238;
  float Area = pow(R, 2) * Pi;
  return Area;
}

void PrintResult(float Area)
{
  cout << "Circle Area is : " << Area << endl;
}

int main()
{
  PrintResult(CircleArea(ReadRadious()));

  return 0;
}
